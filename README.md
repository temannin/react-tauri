# React + Tauri

A minimal example of Tauri running a react app for beginners.

## How do I get it running?

1. [Go here and setup your environment to get ready for Tauri](https://tauri.studio/en/docs/getting-started/intro#setting-up-your-environment)
2. Open a terminal and run `git clone --depth=1 --branch=main https://github.com/temannin/react-tauri.git *your-app-name*`
3. Remove any .git folder info
4. `cd *your-app-name*`
5. Run the `yarn` command
6. After installation, run `yarn dev`
   1. This repo utilizes the npm package `concurrently` so that you don't have to open two terminal windows to get the example running.
7. Done! ![A running example of Tauri + React running](https://github.com/temannin/react-tauri/blob/main/docs/running.png?raw=true)
