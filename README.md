# React + Tauri

A minimal example of Tauri running a react app for beginners.

## How do I get it running?

1. [Go here and setup your environment to get ready for Tauri](https://tauri.studio/en/docs/getting-started/intro#setting-up-your-environment)
2. `npx degit https://github.com/temannin/react-tauri.git *your-app-name*`
3. `cd *your-app-name*`
4. Run the `yarn` command
5. After installation, run `yarn dev`
   1. This repo utilizes the npm package `concurrently` so that you don't have to open two terminal windows to get the example running.
6. Done! ![A running example of Tauri + React running](https://github.com/temannin/react-tauri/blob/main/docs/running.png?raw=true)
